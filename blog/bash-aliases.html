                <h3>Intro</h3>
                <p>
                    As we develop our command line skills, I thought I'd share a cool trick I know that will make your command line experience even zippier. You may have noticed that changing to a frequently used directory can require a pretty lengthy command.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Wouldn't it be nice if instead of typing
                    <code>cd ~/Documents/Dropbox/dev-bootcamp</code>, you could simply type
                    <code>dbc</code>?
                </p>
                <h3>The Solution: Bash Aliases (Linux and Mac)</h3>
                <p>Bash aliases are essentially custom keyboard shortcuts for your command line.</p>
                <p>
                    Navigate to your home folder (
                    <code>cd ~</code>), and once you're there, you can view the contents by typing
                    <code>ls</code>, as you know. But did you know you can also include the invisible files (those beginning with a dot <code>.</code>) by typing
                    <code>ls -a</code>?
                </p>
                <p>We will be editing one of the invisible files in your home folder, which is named <code>.bash_profile</code></p>
                <h3>Adding an Alias</h3>
                <p>
                    Once you're in your home directory (<code>~</code>), open your <code>.bash_profile</code>. 
                </p>
                <p class="side-note">*Dev Bootcamp students can type
                    <code>subl .bash_profile</code> to open it for editing. This file was modified with <a href="https://github.com/supertopher/dotfiles" target="_blank">supertopher's dotfiles</a> during Phase 0, Week 0, so you'll already see some custom codes in this file.
                </p>
                <p> 
                    Add an alias by typing (on its own line), for example:
                    <code>alias dbc="cd ~/Documents/Dropbox/dev-bootcamp"</code> (don't put spaces around the <code>=</code> sign). This is just an example alias, using the folder location for my own dev-bootcamp folder on my own computer. You can change the <code>dbc</code> to whatever shortcut you'd like to type (just make sure it's not already an existing bash command), and then you can put whatever command you want after the <code>=</code> sign.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you want the alias to execute two or more commands, just separate the commands with a semicolon. For instance, if I want to navigate to my Dev Bootcamp folder and ALSO display the contents, with hidden files included, I would make my alias like this:
                    <code>alias dbc="cd ~/Documents/Dropbox/dev-bootcamp; ls -a"</code> Then, make sure to save your <code>.bash_profile</code> when you're done editing it. You may notice that your new alias/shortcut doesn't work in your shell yet. That's because your current shell session is still using the old version of your <code>.bash_profile</code>. You have to reload it like this:
                    <code>source ~/.bash_profile</code>. Now you can try typing your new alias in your command line, and watch it execute your command(s)!
