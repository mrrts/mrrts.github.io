			<h2>Web Developer in Chicago, IL</h2>
		</header>

		<p>
			Thanks for checking out my website. I've always loved solving web-development logic problems 
			as a hobby, and now I'm thrilled to be transitioning toward a career where I can build exciting
			projects, not only full-time, but also with other human beings!   
		</p>
		<p>
			I am from Kansas, specifically the suburbs of KC, and have a background in theatre and music. 
			This passion led me to Northwestern University, where I cherished the vibrant theatre community
			balanced by a broad, challenging, and diversified curriculum. If I could have majored in twelve subjects,
			I would have! Late in my time at NU, I became
			a Christian and tired of the self-glorifying aspects of acting, leading me to seek a season after graduation
			of focused servanthood. During this time, I have been enjoying a rewarding tenure in the people
			business, serving coffee (<em>not</em> just in the coffee business serving people!) at Starbucks, while 
			also actively serving my church family as a worship music leader, webmaster, overseas mission worker, and volunteer. 
		</p>
		<p>
			I'm now hoping to focus on establishing a career in the adventurous world of web development as 
			a way to develop and challenge myself. Above all, I want to work with a smart and creative team.
			Quite often I get emotional when the whole ensemble
			in a musical starts singing the chorus together in perfect harmony, and I don't know exactly why, but 
			I know it has something to do with the beauty of teamwork, harmony, and shared vision. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Also, the best coffee at Starbucks is the Ethiopia Yirgacheffe brewed on the Clover machine
			("Reserve" stores only). Just thought you should know.
