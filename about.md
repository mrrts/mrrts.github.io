## About Me

Thanks for checking out my website. I've always loved solving web-development logic problems as a hobby, and now I'm thrilled to be transitioning toward a career where I can build exciting projects, not only full-time, but also with other human beings!

I am from Kansas, specifically the suburbs of KC, and have a background in theatre and music. This passion led me to Northwestern University, where I cherished the vibrant theatre community balanced by a broad, challenging, and diversified curriculum. If I could have majored in twelve subjects, I would have! Late in my time at NU, I became a Christian and tired of the self-glorifying aspects of acting, leading me to seek a more service-oriented season after graduation. During this time, I have been enjoying a terrific-smelling tenure in the people business, serving coffee (_not_ just in the coffee business serving people!) at Starbucks, while also actively serving my church family as a worship music leader, webmaster, overseas mission worker, and volunteer.

I'm now hoping to focus on establishing a career in the adventurous world of web development as a way to develop and challenge myself. Above all, I want to work with a smart and creative team. Quite often I get emotional when the whole ensemble in a musical starts singing the chorus together in perfect harmony, and I don't know exactly why, but I know it has something to do with the beauty of teamwork, resolve, and shared vision.

Also, the best coffee at Starbucks is the Ethiopia Yirgacheffe brewed on the Clover machine ("Reserve" stores only). Just thought you should know.
